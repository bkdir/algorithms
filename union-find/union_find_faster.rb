# This version, as an improvement, considers sites as nodes. 
# Whole hierarchy is a tree.
# Links nodes together and travels from node to root to figure out if given pair is under
# the same component.
#
# for N sites, order of growths (worst case):
#   find  -> tree height
#   union -> tree height
